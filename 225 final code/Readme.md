<h1> Notes on the code: </h1>
<h2> 1. Amain contains the all code except the controllers portion. 
<h3> a) Change the value of 'v' at the top to get the values for different values.
<h3> b) Bode, Nyquist, root locus plots, as well as Zero input response plot and Step response plots are all commented. PLease uncomment them to get the plot.
<h2> 2. v2case.m (v=3.5 m/s) and v3case.m (v=5 m/s) contain the code where we demonstrated stability using example values , using Proportional controller and PID controller respectively.
<h3> 3. Please launch sisotool and import the session data files v2controller.mat [proportional controller for v=3.5 m/s]   and v3controller.mat [PID controller for v=5 m/ps]  to see the entire controller parameters including compensator, design requirements, Root locus plot, Step response plot etc.
